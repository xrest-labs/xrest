# Settings

The **Settings** view allows users to configure global application preferences.

## Theme Selection
- Choose between **Light**, **Dark**, or **System** (follows OS theme).
- The selection is persisted in `settings.yaml` under the `theme` key.

## Future Extensions
- Add language selection.
- Configure default request timeout.
- Manage plugin integrations.

::: tip
The Settings view currently only exposes theme selection, but the architecture is ready for additional global preferences.
